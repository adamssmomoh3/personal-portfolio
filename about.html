        <p>
          My name is <strong>Sahr Adams Momoh</strong>, and I am a proud Sierra Leonean,
           hailing from the vibrant Eastern Region, specifically the heart of Kono District. 
           My educational journey is one I cherish deeply, as it shaped the foundation of who I am today. 
           It all began at my mother's cherished school, <strong>F A W A Primary School</strong>, 
           located in the lively town of Koidu City, where I attended from Class 1 to 3. I later continued my studies at
            <strong>Baptist Primary School</strong> for Class 3 to 4 and then at <strong>First Baptist Primary School</strong>
             from Class 5 to 6. It was at this final step of my primary education that I successfully sat for the <strong>NPSE</strong>
              exam, marking a significant milestone in my academic path.
        </p>

        </p>
        <p>
          My journey through junior secondary education was both enriching and formative.  
          I attended the esteemed <strong>Unique International Secondary School</strong> from J.S.S. 1 to 2,  
          and then transitioned to the historic <strong>Koidu Secondary School</strong> from J.S.S. 2 to 3,  
          where I successfully completed my <strong>BECE</strong> exam.  
        </p>
        <p>
          Building on this foundation, I pursued my senior secondary education with dedication,  
          advancing from S.S.S. 1 to 3. This chapter of my academic life culminated in  
          the successful completion of the prestigious <strong>WASSCE</strong> exam,  
          marking the fulfillment of my high school journey.

            <em>“Transforming ideas into digital experiences that inspire.”</em>  
          </p>
          <p>
            I am a web developer passionate about creating beautiful and functional websites  
            that leave a lasting impression. My journey began with <strong>FreeCodeCamp</strong>,  
            where I built a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, laying the groundwork for my creative aspirations.

          </p>
          <p>
            Currently, I am on an exciting journey to expand my knowledge in web development,  
            diving into advanced technologies like <strong>React</strong> and <strong>Node.js</strong>.  
            My goal is to craft seamless, user-centered designs that blend aesthetics with functionality.

          <h3>Beyond Coding</h3>
          <p>
            Beyond coding, I enjoy sketching and writing stories for children,
            especially those inspired by Sierra Leone’s rich history. My dream
            is to create engaging content that educates and entertains the
            younger generation. When I’m not working on my projects, I love
            hiking and spending time with my family.
